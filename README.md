## 1st assignment in "Software Design with Python" course 

    There are 5 files in repository: task_1 - task_4.py and main.py. 
    task_1 - task_4.py are included in main

* __task_1.py__ - Creates a function decorator that calculates function execution time and the number of times the decorated function was called (function call trace).
* __task_2.py__ - Extends task_1.py by printing some information about function, like:
    * Name
    * Type
    * Signature
    * Information about arguments
    * Docstring
    * Source coed
    * Output
* __task_3.py__ - this file contains decorator behavior in tasks 1 & 2 using a class decorator. All the program output (from the decorator) should be dumped into a .txt file.
* __task_4.py__ - final extention. It extends function and class decorators so that if a decorated function encounters an error it pipes the error stream into a log file together with a timestamp.Log file's name is  "log.txt"
* __main.py__ - this file is used to test task_1 - task_4.py. This file is ready to run. Some part of output will be printed in Python stdout, while other will be printed in .txt files.

# How to run:
